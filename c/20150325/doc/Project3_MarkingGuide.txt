CMPT 300 Coding Project 3 Marking Guide

Assignment must be done individually.

Total =  [75] marks.

[35] Program Execution and Threads
    - Launch correct number of factory and kid threads.
    - Correct operation of factory and kid threads.
    - Correctly signal factories to exit.
    - Correctly wait on candy in buffer.
    - Correctly cancel kids.
    Suggested Penalties start at ~5 marks.

[10] Bounded Buffer and Synchronization
    - Correct operation and synchronization of bounded buffer.
    - Any race condition or synchronization problem likely leads to grade of 0 here.

[10] Statistics
    - Correctly formatted table
    - Correctly accumulated data

[10] Correct Memory Access
    - No incorrect memory accesses (buffer overflow, ...)
    - No memory leaks; all memory freed at exit
      (except any "still reachable" allocations from pthread library).
    - Will be tested with valgrind
    Suggested penalties start at ~5 marks.

[5] File structure
    - Spilt into at least 3 C files
    - Clean interface to C modules
      (may not be checked in detail, but can lose marks for poor interface).
    - Makefile builds project correctly.

[5] Good code quality
    - Check for non-positive arguments
    - Near perefct indentation and great code structure.
    - Code which does not compile will receive 0 marks total.
    - Reasonable names for variables and functions.


Suggested test cases:
    1 factory, 10 kids, 10 seconds:
    - Should generate very low delays.

    10 factories, 1 kid, 10 seconds:
    - Should generate large delays and extra candy in buffer to clear before ending kid thread.

    20 factories, 20 kids, 15 seconds:
    - Many threads operating

    All tests run with Valgrind:
    valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --num-callers=20 ./candykids 8 1 1

- Material is suspiciously similar to another submission or code posted online.
