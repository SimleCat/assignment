We received some questions about project 2 regarding the skeleton code.
It seems like the skeleton code does not work as expected sometimes for some students.
This may have to do with the following reasons:
- HTTP 1.0/1.1 handling on the Web-servers being tested.
- Requests sent to the Web-server are not correctly constructed.
- Different web browser has different behaviors.
- Javascript can also be the reason causing unexpected behaviors.

As a result, we allow students to state in their documentation:
- The website they use for testing.
- The web browser they use for testing.
- Describe limitations of their programs, and any unexpected behavior may occur.
As long as the limitations are not significant, no marks will be deducted.
However, if you do not specify the limitations and/or unexpected behaviors of your programs, and when they occur, marks will be deducted.
For example, if your proxy server keeps crashing, and you do not explain why, marks will be deducted.
On the other hand, if you explain why (as accurate as possible), only a small amount of marks will be deducted due to its significance.

Your programs will be tested using the website stated in your documentation with the same format described in the project description.
Unless someone can confirm Safari is installed on the computers in CSIL, please do not use Safari.

P.S. Make sure to delete your cache when you test your programs; otherwise, you will always get the same results.
